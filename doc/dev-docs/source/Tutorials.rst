Obtaining µSpectre
******************

**µSpectre** is hosted on a git repository on `c4science`_. To clone it, run

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://c4science.ch/source/muSpectre.git

or if you prefer identifying yourself using a public ssh-key, run

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone ssh://git@c4science.ch/source/muSpectre.git

The latter options requires you to have a user account on c4science (`create <https://c4science.ch/auth/start/>`_).
