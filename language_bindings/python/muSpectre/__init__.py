    Instantiate a muSpectre Cell class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nb_grid_pts: list
        Grid nb_grid_pts in the Cartesian directions.
    domain_lengths: list
        Physical size of the cell in the Cartesian directions.
    formulation: Formulation
        Formulation for strains and stresses used by the solver. Options are
        `Formulation.finite_strain` and `Formulation.small_strain`. Finite
        strain formulation is the default.
    gradient: list of subclasses of DerivativeBase
        This is the Nabla operator in vector form (a list of one instance of
        `DerivativeBase` per spatial direction). It is used to automatically
        construct the projection operator. The default is FourierDerivative for
        each direction.
    fft: string
        FFT engine to use. Options are 'fftw', 'fftwmpi', 'pfft' and 'p3dfft'.
        Default is 'fftw'.
    communicator: mpi4py or muFFT communicator
        communicator object passed to parallel FFT engines. Note that
        the default 'fftw' engine does not support parallel execution.


    Returns
    -------
    cell: object
        Return a muSpectre Cell object.
